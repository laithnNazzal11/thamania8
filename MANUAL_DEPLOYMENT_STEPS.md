# 🚀 Manual Deployment Steps - Run These Commands

## 📋 **You Need to Run These Commands Manually:**

Since Vercel login requires interactive authentication, please run these commands in your terminal:

### 1. **Login to Vercel (Interactive)**
```bash
# You're already in the frontend directory
vercel login
```

**What will happen:**
- Choose "Continue with GitHub" or "Continue with Google" 
- A browser window will open
- Login with your GitHub/Google account
- Return to terminal when authentication is complete

### 2. **Deploy to Production**
```bash
vercel --prod
```

**You'll be prompted with:**
- ✅ **Set up and deploy?** → Choose `Y` (Yes)
- ✅ **Which scope?** → Choose your account name
- ✅ **Link to existing project?** → Choose `N` (No)
- ✅ **What's your project's name?** → Type `thamanea` (or your choice)
- ✅ **In which directory is your code located?** → Press Enter (default `./`)

### 3. **Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)**
You'll see output like:
```
🔗  Linked to your-username/thamanea (created .vercel)
🔍  Inspect: https://vercel.com/your-username/thamanea/...
✅  Production: https://thamanea.vercel.app [2s]
```
